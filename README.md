Pickin' Sticks 
============= 
Pickin-Sticks. Yay :) Best. Game. Ever. Ignore all the things about All Right Received. The game is completely Open Source with Absolutely no license. It's just something Xcode Adds for every file you create. I will try to remove them but I might miss some. Shoutout to my Friend Grayson for the help with the artwork @gray-host.
